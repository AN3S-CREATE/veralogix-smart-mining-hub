# Technical Q&A Archive (2026-01)

## Topic: Message Processing Request
**Date**: 2026-01-08
**Context**: Request to clean and structure message logs for GitHub storage.

**Query**: Process messages for repository storage by filtering for relevant technical content, removing AI/system prompts, and formatting the output as markdown with topic/date headers, question/response structure, and meaningful filenames (including timestamps and a table of contents when needed).

**Response**: No source message transcript was provided in the repository or request. Provide the raw messages to be processed so they can be filtered, cleaned, and formatted for archival.
